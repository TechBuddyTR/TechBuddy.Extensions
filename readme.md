## Introduction

This solution is to contribute open-source community. We are aiming to create Extension libraries (nuget packages) for AspNet projects.
There are many common patterns/tools that most of us are using mostly on our WebApi projects. 
With the nuget packages provided by the projects under this solution, it will be easy to implement those libraries with their default configurations.
Not only it will be only a single line of code to use them with default configs, but also you will be able to customize them.

> PS: This project is being developed by the Community of TechBuddyTR [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechBuddyTR)

### Extensions

There are four different extension libraries planned which are;

 - [ApiVersioning](https://github.com/TechBuddyTR/TechBuddy.Extensions/tree/dev/src/ApiVersioningExtension/ApiVersioningExtension)
 - Global Exception Handling
 - [Validations (FluentValidation based)](https://github.com/TechBuddyTR/TechBuddy.Extensions/tree/dev/src/ValidationExtension/ValidationExtension)
 - OpenApi Support (Swagger, Swagger UI)


Every extension library will have their own NuGet Packages. Please find the details under the project folders.
